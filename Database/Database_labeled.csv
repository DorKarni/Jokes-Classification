360541,378653,Sheldon, Of course if SkyNet actually did exist in the future a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series lulling us into a false sense of security ie That's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles No Summer don't kill me I'm prorobot,JOKE,,,,
381922,384009,Leonard, At least he's off the train crap,JOKE,,,,

401775,418249,Howard, You're overlooking something I have 11 hours with her in a confined space Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train tuck and roll down the side of a hill she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz,SENTENCE,,,,

557885,560238,Leonard, So you'll send him an email when we get back,SENTENCE,,,,
560686,566666,Sheldon, Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it  Right Of course  This is an unmitigated disaster,SENTENCE,,,,
566791,571584,???, There's nothing you can do about it so relax Sit back enjoy the clicketyclack,SENTENCE,,,,

266817,279061,Sheldon, Then it hits her How is she going to survive? I mean she has no prospects no marketable skills And then one day she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard,JOKE~,,,,
282933,284901,Penny, Hang on Let's see where he's going,JOKE,,,,
286503,294210,Sheldon, She befriends them and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea which she steals and sells to the highest bidder,SENTENCE,,,,

411845,413396,Sheldon, Oh dear Lord we're doomed,JOKE~,,,,
415565,424240,Leonard, So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation but over here you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients,SENTENCE,,,,
430781,438688,Sheldon, This diagram I assume you were opening with a joke It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps,JOKE~,,,,
439723,441924,Leonard, It's not a joke It's the real design,SENTENCE,,,,
441925,447296,Sheldon, In that case may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?,JOKE~,,,,
450934,460876,Sheldon, Oh I'mI'm sorry I assumed that you wanted candid truthtelling from your employees but I realize now you want the mindless nattering of complacent yesmen,JOKE~,,,,

482899,486168,Sheldon, Does it? A happy accident,JOKE~,,,,
486169,489905,Leonard, We're not doing names now Howard?,SENTENCE,,,,
493243,509759,Sheldon, SHELDON All right fine If we're not going to give it a name can we at least give it a secret code designation?  No  Hear me out The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago For our app I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs,JOKE,,,,
518935,527777,Sheldon, I see Is that decision open for discussion? No Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion? No,JOKE~,,,,

607374,622137,Sheldon, They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man,JOKE~,,,,
622138,629812,Leonard, Look I'm still happy to drive you to work Nothing's changed in that regard We're still roommates we're still friends,SENTENCE,,,,

1029325,1030792,Raj, What do you think we should sell it for?,SENTENCE,,,,

1151447,1160721,Sheldon, Of course He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be,JOKE~,,,,
1160722,1164492,Penny, Yeah Yeah that was my plan All right Come on Let's go,JOKE~,,,,

1345,54792,Sheldon, Good evening I'm your guest lecturer Dr Sheldon Cooper I was expecting applause but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate I agreed to speak to you this evening because I was told that you're the best and the brightest of this university's doctoral candidates Hmm Of course that's like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom 'Cause you see there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom Best and brightest my sweet patootie All right let's begin Show of hands who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don't kid yourselves,JOKE~,,,,
57095,69106,Leonard, I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture Dr Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable Plus he looks like a giant insect,JOKE~,,,,
90629,94732,Howard, Apparently if you're Sheldon all you need to do is turn your back,SENTENCE,,,,

158447,161465,Howard, Actually we should all share the moment Raj if you would,SENTENCE,,,,
172044,183721,Sheldon, That's rather unfair That's downright cruel Plus insects have six legs Yeah I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN,SENTENCE,,,,
183722,187291,Leonard, From the context we think it means kill me now,JOKE,,,,
190428,200338,Sheldon, Well I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion I think I'll turn in I didn't want to teach those poopy heads anyway,JOKE,,,,
203875,209613,Howard, FYI I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star,JOKE~,,,,
234835,236072,Howard, Sheldon still moping?,JOKE~,,,,
241135,257684,Raj, I know the feeling It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you ItIt happened to a friend of mine,JOKE,,,,
257685,259852,Bernadette, Are you guys doing okay?,SENTENCE,,,,
259853,264090,Howard, Leonard and I are fine but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon,JOKE,,,,

316710,318211,Sheldon, No,JOKE~,,,,
319480,324217,Amy, Well that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy,JOKE~,,,,
331725,336396,Amy, If this humiliating experience is really troubling you there are things we could do about it,SENTENCE,,,,
344772,353413,Sheldon, Hmm no One slip of the hand and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department building doodads with Wolowitz,SENTENCE,,,,
360387,364958,Sheldon, Isn't that their burden? I'm the one with something interesting to say,SENTENCE,,,,
364959,375168,Amy, Fair enough but in its essence teaching is a performance art In the classroom paradigm the teacher has the responsibility to communicate as well as entertain and engage,SENTENCE,,,,
375169,380473,Sheldon, I sense that you're trying to slowwalk me to an epiphany Would you mind very much jumping to it?,SENTENCE,,,,
383978,400510,Sheldon, Acting lessons Interesting It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn Penny Penny Penny,JOKE~,,,,
405466,410503,Penny, I'm not an actress I'm an actress,JOKE~,,,,

421348,424150,Penny, Okay where is this coming from?,JOKE~,,,,
424151,434260,Sheldon, It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing at which if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed I suck the big one,SENTENCE,,,,
434261,439865,Penny, Yeah I saw those They were funny I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge,SENTENCE,,,,
439866,441801,Sheldon, So when could we start?,JOKE~,,,,
441802,448741,Penny, Okay just to be clear You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr Sheldon Cooper doesn't,SENTENCE,,,,
448742,452545,Sheldon, I suppose that's one way to look at it,SENTENCE,,,,
452546,455315,Penny, I think it's the only way to look at it,JOKE~,,,,
455316,457216,Sheldon, Are you going to help me or not?,JOKE~,,,,
457217,463256,Penny, Probably I'm just enjoying the foreplay Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?,SENTENCE,,,,
463257,471731,Sheldon, Oh I'm sorry I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road,JOKE,,,,

705548,726368,Amy, Well granted Penny your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious But Priya is highly educated she's an accomplished professional and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex Whereas you on the other hand are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows,JOKE~,,,,
726369,732808,Penny, Yeah Okay I got it I got it So what is all that stuff?,SENTENCE,,,,
